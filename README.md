# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of life in p5.js

#Technicals
I refactored the maze-solver code seperating the Grid into its own object so that 
I could create a copy of the Cells array in order to get the simulation running properly.

Press any key to start/pause the simulation. Use a mouse-click to flip the status of a cell.
